# NW-HideByCoords-Faster
Similar to "NW-HideByCoords", but faster by using Clasher. Requires some setup in the NW file though.

How to install and use from batch file, see here: https://github.com/Henaccount/NW-HideByCoords

Additionally you can use it in Navisworks (tested with NW Manage 2020). You select a tree element and execute the script. As a result you will just get the area shown that is covered or touched by the bounding box of the tree element. Also the file will be saved with this visibility state.
